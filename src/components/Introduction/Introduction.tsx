          I am a person who is very positive about every aspect of life. I am a
          hardworking, talented individual. There are many things I like to do,
          to see, and to experience. My greatest passion in life is to build a
          system that connects with people around the globe and I also want to
          help the community with my programming knowledge in any way I can. I
          am always eager to be challenged to grow and further improve my skills
          in both scientific and technical fields.
